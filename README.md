Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.

ADK web is the built-in dev UI that comes along with adk for easier development and debug.

## ✨ Prerequisite

- **Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)**

- **Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)**

- **Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli)**

- **Install [google-adk (Python)](https://github.com/google/adk-python)**

- **Install [google-adk (Java)](https://github.com/google/adk-java/)**

- **Clone [adk-web (this repo)](https://github.com/google/adk-web/)**

## 🚀 Running adk web

To be able to run `adk web`, follow the steps from the root of your local
adk-web folder:

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo npm install
```

### Run adk web

```bash
npm run serve --backend=http://localhost:8000
```

### Run adk api server

In another terminal run:

```bash
adk api_server --allow_origins=http://localhost:4200 --host=0.0.0.0
```

If you see `adk command not found`, then be sure to install `google-adk` (or remember to activate your virtual environment if you are using one)

### Happy development

Go to `localhost:4200` and start developing!

### And more!

## 🔐 Authentication (Optional)

ADK Web supports optional OIDC authentication for enterprise deployments. When enabled, users must authenticate via an OIDC-compliant provider before accessing the UI. When disabled (default), the UI is accessible without authentication.

### Supported Providers

Any OIDC-compliant identity provider works, including:
- **Keycloak** (including Red Hat build of Keycloak)
- **Okta** / Auth0
- **Azure AD** / Entra ID
- **Google Identity Platform**
- Any provider with a standard `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint

### Enabling Authentication

Add an `auth` section to `runtime-config.json`:

```json
{
  "backendUrl": "http://localhost:8000",
  "auth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "authority": "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/my-realm",
    "clientId": "adk-web-ui",
    "scopes": "openid profile email"
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Yes | Set to `true` to enable OIDC authentication |
| `authority` | Yes | OIDC issuer URL. For Keycloak: `https://host/realms/{realm}` |
| `clientId` | Yes | OIDC public client ID registered with your provider |
| `scopes` | No | Space-separated scopes (default: `openid profile email`) |
| `silentRefresh` | No | Enable background token refresh (default: `true`) |
| `postLogoutRedirectUri` | No | URL to redirect to after logout |

### Kubernetes / Container Deployments

For container deployments, enable auth without rebuilding by injecting a ConfigMap:

```javascript
// Mount as runtime-config.js and include via script tag, or
// inject into runtime-config.json via ConfigMap mount
window.__ADK_CONFIG__ = {
  auth: {
    enabled: true,
    authority: "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/kagenti",
    clientId: "adk-web-ui"
  }
};
```

`window.__ADK_CONFIG__` takes priority over `runtime-config.json`.

### Integration with Kagenti + SPIFFE/SPIRE

When agents are managed by [Kagenti](https://github.com/kagenti) with SPIFFE/SPIRE zero-trust security, OIDC authentication provides the browser-to-agent security layer:

```
Browser  --OIDC-->  Identity Provider  --JWT-->  Browser
   |
   |  Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
   v
Envoy AuthBridge (Kagenti sidecar)  --validates JWT-->  ADK Agent
   |
   |  SPIFFE/SPIRE mTLS (automatic via ztunnel)
   v
Backend Services (SonataFlow, MCP servers, etc.)
```

The UI handles the first hop (Browser to Envoy). Kagenti infrastructure handles the second hop (Agent to Services) via SPIFFE/SPIRE mTLS -- no application code changes needed.

### Security Model

- **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is enforced for all authorization flows
- **Fail-closed**: if auth is enabled but a token cannot be obtained, requests are blocked rather than sent without credentials
- **Automatic refresh**: tokens are silently refreshed before expiry
- **Provider-agnostic**: uses standard `oidc-client-ts`, not provider-specific adapters

### Behavior When Auth Is Enabled

When authentication is active, the "User ID" text field in the toolbar is replaced by an authenticated user menu showing the user's name, email, and roles from the OIDC token.

### OpenShift / Kubernetes Deployment

A container image can be built using the standard Angular build and any static file server (nginx, Caddy, etc.). Auth is configured at runtime via `runtime-config.json` mounted as a ConfigMap -- no image rebuild needed when switching OIDC providers or disabling auth.

### Keycloak Client Setup

If using Keycloak as your OIDC provider, create a public client:

1. Login to the Keycloak admin console
2. Select your realm (e.g. `kagenti`)
3. Go to **Clients** > **Create client**
4. Set:
   - **Client ID**: `adk-web-ui`
   - **Client type**: OpenID Connect
   - **Client authentication**: OFF (public client)
   - **Standard flow**: ON
   - **Direct access grants**: ON (optional, for testing)
5. Under **Access settings**, set:
   - **Root URL**: `https://<your-adk-web-route>`
   - **Valid redirect URIs**: `https://<your-adk-web-route>/*`
   - **Web origins**: `+` (allows all origins from redirect URIs)
6. Save the client

### Demo Test Prompts

After deploying the agents and the UI, use these prompts to verify the system works:

**Use Case 1 -- F5 VIP Provisioning** (select the `f5_provisioning` agent):

```
I need to provision a new F5 VIP. The hostname is myapp.prod.internal.bank.com,
IP 10.120.100.50, port 443, pool members 10.120.100.10:8443 and 10.120.100.11:8443,
partition production, VLAN 120. Validate the DNS naming, check for conflicts,
and trigger the provisioning workflow.
```

Expected: The agent validates DNS naming conventions, checks subnet/VLAN compliance,
reviews historical assignments, and either proceeds with the workflow or flags issues.

**Use Case 2 -- Branch Network Monitoring** (select the `branch_monitor` agent):

```
Proactively check all Charlotte branches for network risks. Get branch inventory,
weather alerts for Mecklenburg county NC, power outage and ISP status, equipment
health, and correlate threats. Flag any branches at risk.
```

Expected: The agent calls 15+ tools (inventory, weather, power, ISP, equipment, correlation),
produces a threat assessment per branch (HIGH/LOW with scores), and triggers response
workflows for HIGH-threat branches.

### Testing quirks

To maintain compatibility with upstream 1p code, testing code in this repo must
follow a few rules:

- `initTestBed()` from `./src/app/testing/utils.ts` must be called before `TestBed.configureTestingModule()`
